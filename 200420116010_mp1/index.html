        <h2>Section One</h2>
        <p>
            Located in the state of Jammu and Kashmir, the humble land of Ladakh in India is cradled by the ice-capped Kunlun mountain range in the north and the Great Himalayas to the south, providing a breathtaking panoramic view all around.
            <br>
            Due to extreme weather conditions which see temperatures plummet to minus 35 degree Celsius, the area remains scarcely populated, resulting in a clean and pristine environment. Once you land in Ladakh, you feel miles away from home; you could be at the very gates of heaven. Clear blue skies, wide landscapes of cold desert, ice-capped mountains and the soft cold mountain breeze against your skin makes you feel cradled in nature’s arms.

            Ladakh is well known as the ‘Land of the Gompas’ (or monasteries). Historically the region is of Tibetan descent and host to many Buddhist monasteries. Most famed are Thiksay, Hemis, Shey and Dhankar. The monasteries house several Buddhists who spend their entire life studying and learning.

            Climate: The region of Ladakh rests in altitudes ranging from about 9,000 feet (2750m) at Kargil to 25,170 feet (7,672m) at Saser Kangri in the Karakoram. At these altitudes temperature extremities are intense. The best time to visit is in summer between June and October when the temperature is at its most pleasant. November invites heavy snowfall and temperatures drop drastically to negatives.
            <br>
            Health: Due to its high geographical altitude, oxygen levels are low. Initially you might find yourself breathing a little heavier than usual and its advised that you give your body time to acclimatise before setting out on any physical activity. There is a local hospital in Leh if the need arises and you feel uncomfortable.
